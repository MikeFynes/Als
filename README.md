App to explore GCP capabilities and links to Google Drive


TODO
- Make UI Beautiful
    - React or Angular perhaps?
    - Datatables.js for displaying information?
- Do not allow insertion of same file if Drive ID already exists.
- Switch away from base JPA connection (urgh) to something sensible like Hibernate with HikariCP
